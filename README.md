## ðŸ’° Profit Insights
Differentiating markets by **Revenue, Profit Contribution, and Profit Margin** profitability by market and customer is visualized to identify high- and low-margin areas.

## ðŸ’ª Performance Insights
As the name suggests, this dashboard analyzes the performance of the company. Report includes a drill-through analysis for comparing **Profit Margins** across zones, markets, customers, and products.

- **1st drill-through** shows profit margin of each zone: North, Central, South. **2nd drill-through** shows the profit margin of each markets. **3rd drill-through** shows profit margin of each customers. **4th drill-through** shows the profit margin of each product.
- Unlike the profit analysis, using the **Profit Target** slicer, we can judge the performance of each drill-through category by setting a profit goal.
- The **Revenue Trend** graph is also different as it compares last year's revenue to the next when focusing on the bar graph. The line graph shows an interesting relationship between **revenue** and **profit**, where starting july 2018 as **profit margin increased, revenue decreased**.
